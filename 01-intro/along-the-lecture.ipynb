      "\n",
      "3. Seek instructor permission: In some cases, you may be able to get permission directly from the course instructor to enroll late. The instructor may be willing to work with you to help you catch up on any missed material.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider auditing the course: If you can't officially enroll, you may be able to audit the class instead. This allows you to participate without receiving credit or a grade.\n",

      "5. Wait for the next term: If enrolling late is not possible, you may need to wait until the next term or semester to take the course.\n",
